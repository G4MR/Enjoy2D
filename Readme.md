### Prerequisites

* SDL2 via nimble (`nimble install sdl2`)
* SDL2 binaries for your OS (`win32-x86-dlls.zip` below)

### Building 

Check the config.ini file to enable/disable things as well as nim.cfg 
on how you should build your project.  Then it's as simple as:

`nim c app.nim` or you can build the examples included ` nim c examples/skeleton.nim`

Enjoy until I get real docs up and finish tweaking.  PR's are welcome.
